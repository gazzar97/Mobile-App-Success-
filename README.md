# Mobile-App-Success-
It is a Machine Learning module that can predict the rate of the app out of Five.

*This program consists of two main modules to predict  how a specific app will gain success depending on 
some features which we selected for the prediction process.

- Two modules we used for our program.

    1. Regression module for continuous variable.
    2. Classification module for categorical variable.
  
### Brief description about Regression module

- we use some of the Regression algorithms to implement module which can predict the rate of the app with
  a high accuracy.
  
  * Regression algorithms we used:
     1. Linear Regression
     2. Polynomial Regression
     
### Brief description about Classification module

- we use some of the Classification modules to implement module which can classify the right category for each 
app.

* Classification algorithms we used:
    1. Logistic Regression
    2. SVM 
    3. Decision Tree
    4. AdaBoost
